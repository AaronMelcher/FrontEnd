        Code the Way facilitates the collaboration of schools, companies, and nonprofits to:
        (1) Offer students advanced computer science training and real-world job experiences working on projects that benefit nonprofits;
        (2) Increase certified computer science teachers;
        and (3) Contribute to the technology talent base
    </p>
    <p>Code the Way model includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Student access to real-world job experience – In addition to an advanced course that may earn post-secondary credits, students get experience working collaboratively on a project that benefits a nonprofit, culminating in a presentation to business leaders.  </li>
        <li>
